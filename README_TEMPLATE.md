# Project Title

## Overview
This project is a Solidity smart contract for a token called "MyToken." It allows for the creation, minting, and burning of tokens.

## Description
The `MyToken` contract is a basic implementation of an ERC-20 token. It includes functionalities for token creation, minting, and burning. The contract keeps track of token balances for different accounts using a mapping. The initial supply of tokens is assigned to the deployer of the contract. Additional tokens can be minted and existing tokens can be burned by the contract owner.

## Getting Started

### Installing
To use this program, you need to have a Solidity development environment set up. Follow these steps:

1. Install Solidity compiler: [https://soliditylang.org/](https://soliditylang.org/)
2. Install a development environment like Remix IDE: [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

### Executing Program

1. Open the Solidity compiler or Remix IDE.
2. Create a new Solidity file and paste the code from `MyToken.sol`.
3. Compile the contract to make sure there are no syntax errors.
4. Deploy the contract on a test network or a local blockchain.
5. Interact with the contract using the provided functions like `mint` and `burn`.
